- text
The <input type="text"> element is a single-line text input field where users can enter plain text. It is the default input type and used for short text inputs like names or titles.

- radio
The <input type="radio"> element creates a radio button, which allows users to select one option from a group. When multiple radio buttons share the same name, only one of them can be selected.

- checkbox
The <input type="checkbox"> element creates a checkbox that allows users to select zero, one, or multiple options independently. Each checkbox works as a toggle(on/off or checekd/unchecked).

- select
The <select> element creates a dropdown list. It contains multiple <option> elements, allowing users to select one (or multiple with multiple attribute) option(s) from a list. It differs from checkboxes and radios as it is a list control rather than an input field.

- date
The <input type="date"> element provides a date picker interface for users to select a date. It ensures the input format is a valid date and usually brings up a calendar UI in browsers.

- textarea
The <textarea> element is a multiline text input field, allowing users to enter larger blocks of text such as comments or descriptions. Unlike <input type="text">, it can span multiple lines and its size can be controlled by rows and columns.
