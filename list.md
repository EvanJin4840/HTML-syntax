## <ul>
* Unordered List
- This tag represents a list of items where the order of the items does not matter. By default, items in an unordered list are displayed with bullet points (e.g., •, ○, ■). It acts as the parent container for the list items.

### <li>
* List Item
- This tag represents an item within a list. An <li> tag must always be a child element of either a <ul> (unordered list) or an <ol> (ordered list). It cannot exist on its own.

### <dl>
* Description List
- The <dl> tag is used to create a list of terms and their descriptions. It's different from <ul> and <ol> because it doesn't use <li> items. Instead, it uses a pair of tags:
- <dt> (Description Term): The term, name, or key.
- <dd> (Description Details): The description, value, or definition for the term above it.

* This structure is perfect for things like:
- A glossary or dictionary.
- Displaying metadata (e.g., Author: J.K. Rowling).
- Question and Answer sections.
