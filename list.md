## <ul>
* Unordered List
- This tag represents a list of items where the order of the items does not matter. By default, items in an unordered list are displayed with bullet points (e.g., •, ○, ■). It acts as the parent container for the list items.

### <li>
* List Item
- This tag represents an item within a list. An <li> tag must always be a child element of either a <ul> (unordered list) or an <ol> (ordered list). It cannot exist on its own.
