#### The margin Shorthand

* The margin property can take between one and four values to specify the spacing around an element.
+  Examples
1. margin: 10px;: All four sides (top, right, bottom, left) are 10px.
2. margin: 10px 20px;: Top and bottom are 10px; left and right are 20px.
3. margin: 10px 20px 30px;: Top is 10px, left and right are 20px, and bottom is 30px.
4. margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;: Top is 10px, right is 20px, bottom is 30px, and left is 40px (in a clockwise order).

### Padding
* Padding is a CSS property that defines the inner spacing of an element, between its content and its border.
- Analogy :Â Think of it like the air inside a box. The content (the words or images) sits inside, and the padding creates a buffer of space between the content and the edges of the box.
